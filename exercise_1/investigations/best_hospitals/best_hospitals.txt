1. My conclusion: 

The best hospitals are...

<provider_id, hospital name, mean procedure score>

291302	WILLIAM BEE RIRIE HOSPITAL	0.530719641361526

2. Why this approach is appropriate:

I realized that different measurements have different ranges of scores. 

For instance, 
<measure_id, mean procedure score> 
EDV	2.2115550445530325
ED_1b	276.96907216494844
ED_2b	100.49224067519738
IMM_2	91.78580201424711

Therefore in order to figure out how to compare different measurements, I have to normalize the scores to zero mean and unit variance. The results are stored in the procedure_normalized table.

I do understand that different measurements can still have different central tendencies even after normalization, but this is probably the best that I can do in reasonable time.

I also realize that a high score for some measurement is bad, while for some it's good. I chose to ignore the cases where a high score correspond to bad performance because a high score is good in the majority of the measurements.

Then, for each hospital / provider_id, I simply found the mean normalized procedure score. This serves as an aggregated statistic to describe the performance of a hospital.


3. Why these results support my conclusion:

The best hospitals are ones that does well across a variety of procedures. Therefore the higher the mean normalized score across the procedures the better a hospital is.
