1. My conclusion: 

The procedures with the highest variability are...

EDV	Emergency Department Volume	0.14066288164571422
OP_31	Percentage of patients aged 18 years and older who had cataract surgery and had improvement in visual function achieved within 90 days following the cataract surgery	0.08565066174207449
OP_2	Fibrinolytic Therapy Received Within 30 Minutes of ED Arrival	0.06371224742620361
OP_29	Appropriate Follow-Up Interval for Normal Colonoscopy in Average Risk Patients	0.060039958308116786
OP_23	Head CT or MRI Scan Results for Acute Ischemic Stroke or Hemorrhagic Stroke Patients who Received Head CT or MRI Scan Interpretation Within 45 minutes of ED Arrival	0.03970367300586667
OP_30	Colonoscopy Interval for Patients with a History of Adenomatous Polyps - Avoidance of Inappropriate Use	0.03716908658403613
STK_4	Thrombolytic Therapy	0.02658035437258476
OP_1	Median Time to Fibrinolysis	0.018644746340072797
IMM_2	Influenza Immunization	0.017682663211899423
VTE_5	Venous Thromboembolism Warfarin Therapy Discharge Instructions	0.017428298999732025


2. Why this approach is appropriate:

I transformed the raw procedure scores by standardizing them. (score - min) / (max - min). This transformation turns scores into the range of 0 to 1. 

For this question, I chose to standardize instead of normalize because normalization converts each measure to have unit variance. However, we are interested in how procedures differ in their standardized variance.

I found the procedures with the greatest variance by finding the variance of a measurement across all hospitals. 

3. Why these results support my conclusion:

The variance of procedures across hospitals give us a sense of how much the quality of a procedure vary across hospitals.

For instance, the standardized variance of OP_31 is 0.0856.
